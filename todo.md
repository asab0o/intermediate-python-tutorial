## Todo List

- [ ] Phase 1: Plan tutorial structure and choose application
  - [x] Decide on the application to build (e.g., To-Do List, Weather App, Note-Taking Tool, Currency Converter).
  - [x] Outline the main sections/steps of the tutorial, linking them to Python concepts.
  - [x] Create a high-level content plan for each section.

- [ ] Phase 2: Create tutorial introduction and setup guide
  - [x] Write an engaging introduction to the tutorial.
  - [x] Provide instructions for setting up the Python environment.
  - [x] Explain how to use the tutorial (e.g., run code, complete exercises).

- [ ] Phase 3: Write foundational steps covering basic concepts
  - [x] Cover functions, conditionals, loops, data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets).
  - [x] Include sample code and exercises for each concept.

- [ ] Phase 4: Develop intermediate steps with OOP and advanced features
  - [x] Introduce Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism).
  - [x] Cover file I/O, error handling, and using external libraries.
  - [x] Include sample code and exercises.

- [ ] Phase 5: Create final steps integrating all concepts into complete app

  - [x] Show how all previously covered concepts are applied in the app.

- [ ] Phase 6: Add exercises, challenges, and next steps section
  - [x] Design comprehensive exercises and challenges related to the application.
  - [x] Suggest further learning resources and next steps for learners.

- [ ] Phase 7: Review, test, and deliver complete tutorial
  - [ ] Review the entire tutorial for clarity, accuracy, and completeness.
  - [ ] Test all code examples and the final application to ensure they work correctly.
  - [ ] Format the tutorial for readability and deliver it to the user.
