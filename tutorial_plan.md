# Python Intermediate Tutorial: Building a Note-Taking Application

## Chosen Application: Simple Command-Line Note-Taking Tool

This application will allow users to:
- Add new notes.
- View all existing notes.
- Edit an existing note.
- Delete a note.
- Save and load notes from a file.

## Tutorial Structure and Key Concepts Covered:

### Section 1: Introduction and Setup
- What this tutorial will cover.
- Setting up Python environment (Python 3, virtual environments).
- How to follow along and run code.

### Section 2: Core Concepts - Building the Foundation
- **Functions:** Defining and calling functions for modularity (e.g., `add_note()`, `view_notes()`).
- **Conditionals (`if`/`elif`/`else`):** Handling user choices in a menu, input validation.
- **Loops (`while`/`for`):** Main application loop, iterating through notes.
- **Data Structures:** Using lists to store notes, potentially dictionaries for note details (title, content).
- **User Input and Output:** Getting input from the user, printing formatted output.

### Section 3: Persistence and Error Handling
- **File I/O:** Reading from and writing to a text file or JSON file to save/load notes.
- **Error Handling (`try`/`except`):** Gracefully handling file not found errors, invalid input.

### Section 4: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Structuring the Application
- **Classes and Objects:** Creating a `Note` class (attributes: title, content, timestamp) and a `NoteManager` class (methods: add, view, edit, delete, save, load).
- **Encapsulation:** Bundling data and methods within classes.
- (Optional, depending on complexity) **Inheritance/Polymorphism:** Briefly touch upon if applicable, or keep it simple for intermediate level.

### Section 5: Bringing It All Together - The Complete Application
- Integrating all components: `Note` class, `NoteManager` class, file I/O, and the main application loop.
- Refactoring and improving the code.

### Section 6: Exercises, Challenges, and Next Steps
- Exercises for each section.
- Challenges to extend the note-taking application (e.g., search functionality, tagging, different storage formats).
- Resources for further learning.
